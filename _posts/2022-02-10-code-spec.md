### 3. Architectural design
Description: The main functionality of the system stems from the user profile data which is stored on the user profile page, where the user can then switch to either browsing mode or dobbie mode. In each mode, the interface displays similar information (prompts, profiles), but the functionality is slightly different – in the dobbie mode, the user can fill out responses to prompts for other users, as well as view other dobbies. In the browsing mode, the user can view other user profile data, and “like” other users. The users can also view which users gave them likes.

### 4. Explain in one paragraph how your system description in (3) enables the requirements described in (1) and (2).
On our Dobbie website, we have 4 main pages (including 2 modes) for users and their friends to interact. First, there is a User Profile Creation page that prompts first-time users to create their own account and profile, one of the primary requirements. Second, after the profile is created, the user’s homepage contains three groups of information: the user profile, any dobbies pending the user’s approval, and the user’s list of friends. On the third page, the user can view others' profiles under browsing mode, where they can see a potential match’s profile and the profile owner’s friends and dobbies. This page enables users to find mutual friends and be reassured that the profile is trustworthy by viewing the dobbies, as described in storyboard 1. When in browsing mode, there is a “like” button that can be clicked to show interest in a person. Lastly, there is a Dobbie mode where the user can leave dobbies for people on their friends list or invite friends to dobbie their profile, as presented in storyboard 2 and 3. In place of the “like” button from browsing mode, there is a “dobbie” button that shows up on the profiles of friends. On the dobbie page, there are pre-written prompts (such as “What are the pros and cons of dating your friend?”) and an option for the user to customize their own creative/fun questions. After dobbies are submitted, the profile owner must approve the responses to have them displayed on the profile.
